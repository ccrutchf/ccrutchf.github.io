I am a fourth-year Ph.D student working under Professor Curt Schurgers and Professor Ryan Kastner.  My Masters was in Intelligent Systems, Robotics, and Control.  I am now putting that background to work by developing sensors for understanding the health of our oceans by developing underwater depth cameras with FishSense, a project which I leads.  Through the use of these cameras, I hope to be able to help scientists monitor the biodiversity of our oceans and the health of the underwater ecosystem.  When not working to help protect our environment, I enjoys a quiet day at home, with my wife and three cats.
