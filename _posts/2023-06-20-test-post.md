Weâ€™d like to introduce the next generation of our FishSense System. FishSense is a camera platform that aims to estimate the mass of fish visible in an image, using a combination of species identification and automatic length measurement. Now, to meet these goals, we present  our FishSense-Lite and FishSense-Pro systems.

Our previous system leveraged an Intel RealSense D455 stereo camera to measure the length of fish, but the lack resolution in both the RGB and depth streams of this camera brought progress to a halt. Though our two new systems are still in active development, we are proud of the headway that has been made and would like to recognize the work being done.
